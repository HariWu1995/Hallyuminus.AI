# Hallyuminus.AI

[Illuminus.ai] **Dialogue System for screenwriting K-drama.**

- This approach targets on using **open-sourced sSsM** (several Small-sized Model), not all-in-1 closed-sourced lLLM (lucirous Large Language Model, like ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.), to simulate participants in a dialogue, including the **narrator** and **characters**.

**Note:** 
- [Character.AI](https://character.ai/) seems very capable of imitating character's characteristics. However, in my experience, it is very easy to manipulate the conversation with the trained bots, so I feel bored in a very short time.
- [Dialogue Model](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/GODEL-v1_1-base-seq2seq) is NOT capable of responding as a participant in a dialogue. It should be named as **Answering Model**. Hence, the result from these pretrained QnaModel doesn't sound good.
