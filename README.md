# Hallyuminus.AI

[Illuminus.ai] Dialogue System for screenwriting K-drama.

This approach targets on using open-sourced MLM (Medium-sized Language Model), not all-in-1 closed-sourced GLM (Giant-sized Language Model, like ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.), to simulate participants in a dialogue, including the narrator and characters.

**Note:** 
- [Character.AI](https://character.ai/) seems very capable of imitating character's characteristics. However, in my experience, it is very easy to manipulate the conversation with the trained bots, so I feel bored in a very short time.
